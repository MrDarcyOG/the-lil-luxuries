<p> hello! i ordered from the lil luxuries! my product was high quality and packaged very well. i live in new zealand so my package had to come a long way! i think that is proof of the lil luxuries 
quality! five stars. posted: 12/14/22 at 14:34 by her majesty geraldine von squirrelingtons. </p>    
<p> good afternoon! i ordered from the lil luxuries on this a fine saturday noon. it was in the middle of the open water swimming months so i had to wait quite some time for my package to arrive. 
however, it was very much worth the wait as my product was high quality. four and a half stars. posted: 06/04/23 at 18:47 by gandalf mcquillton. </p>
<P> this is literally the worst business i have ever bought from. i ordered two months ago and my package is still not here. all the other reviews are fake. do not purchase from the lil luxuries. one 
star is too generous. one star. posted: 01/05/24 at 10:02 by sir pompom higham the great. </p>
<p> reply to sir pompom higham the great: hi, sorry to hear that you are disappointed with the lil luxuries. however, you did not read our about page where we explain that if you purchase in may, your
product will take longer to reach you as we do not wish to disrupt the squirrels open water swimming. i promise your package is on the way, you just have to be patient. posted: 01/05/24 at 13:13 by

<p> this review was edited: the lil luxuries do so much to help red squirrels they deserve a medal. i cannot wait to revieve my package in september but i can wait because i love squirrels and would do 
nothing to disturb their open water swimming. five stars is not generous enough. five stars. reposted: 10/05/24 at 09:18 by sir pompom higham the great. this review was liked by brody garland, ceo of the lil luxuries. </p>
